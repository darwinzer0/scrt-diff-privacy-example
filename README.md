# Differential privacy example on Secret Network

This repository contains an example of differentially private queries on encrypted data stored on Secret Network. It demonstrates COUNT and MEAN queries which are fuzzied using the Laplace mechanism to add noise to the result.

## Running test

Follow the instructions to build the contract in the `contract` folder. Start the dev chain (cosmwasm v1.0 version) and run the test script in `test`. More instructions for building and running tests, respectively, are in the README.md files of each subdirectory.
